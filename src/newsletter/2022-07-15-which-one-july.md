    It's July, and those of us blessed with what's colloquially known as "the ginger skin" are trapped indoors lest we catch fire.
</p>
<h4>Release Updates</h4>
<p>
    Drama Llamas play testing this month has been THE MOST fun. Thanks to the gang who took part and gave such valuable feedback. There'll be another round in August, so get in touch if you like reality TV and/or llamas, and have a flare for the dramatic!
</p>
<h4>Convention Prep</h4>
<p>
    I've been prepping for my first ever convention as a vendor. The up front costs are sobering, but it's spurred me on to put some games into print for the first time, and that's been so special. I can't resist sharing a few photos, so here you go:

<h4>TTRPGs for Good</h4>
<p>
    Another month, another outrageous sign of the times we're living through. Even though we might have known Roe v. Wade's time was limited, and even though it's not the law of my home country that's affected, the sheer scale of the injustice being done to those at risk of unwanted pregnancy in the U.S. knocked the wind out of me. I know I'm not alone in that. Of course, and yet again, the indie community rallied to respond, resulting in the <a href="https://itch.io/b/1472/indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds" target="_blank">Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I've seen some talk about whether these bundles are "fair" to TTRPG creators, who make so little from our art already, when people could just donate without receiving anything in return. Perhaps there's something in that, but while that debate is unresolved one can't argue with results, and every penny that goes towards vital medical care counts. So please do check out the bundle or donate if you're able!

<h4>Review - Odd Jobs</h4>
<img src="/assets/images/newsletter/odd_jobs_book.png" style="width:400px;margin:auto;" alt="picture of the Odd Jobs book on a wooden floor">
<p>
   Continuing my summer reading list of TTRPGs I picked up at UKGE, I recently read through <i>Odd Jobs</i> by Sasha Sienna and Jonathan Sims, available from <a href="https://www.macguffinandcompany.com/products/odd-jobs" target="_blank">MacGuffin & Co</a>. This was a very popular purchase at the expo and in fact was nominated for an <a href="https://ennie-awards.com/" target="_blank">ENNIE</a> while I was making my way through it. Congrats, folks!
</p><p>
   First thing to note is that this is a lot of content. Eleven mini settings, each with their own locations, NPCs, short campaign guide and bonus content. It's an impressive accomplishment, and all written in a bright, approachable style. The settings are system-neutral/adaptable and span such a broad range of genres that there's almost certainly something here that's a strong thematic match for your preferred system. The mood of each world is distinct, moving from monochrome to technicolor, from comedy festive caper to poignant musings on the nature of personhood, all set off by the unique art styles for each setting. Despite this variety the strength of the work and attention to detail feels consistent throughout. Tropes abound and are subverted in fun ways.
<<p>
    There's little point in me offering reviews unless I'm honest when I do have a critique, though, and I did find it hard to read much of this in a single sitting. I was initially confused as to why. The writing style is friendly and witty, the layout is crisp, the art is lovely. But is a lot of prose, and a frustrating amount of it feels like explanation where none is needed. For instance, if "forensic scientist" is offered as a character option in a noir/detective setting, I don't need a long paragraph explaining what one of those is. I'm not sure why the authors have been so sparing with devices other than prose. One exception is a d100 table of bizarre Christmas presents, which I loved. More of this sort of thing would've been welcome, breaking up blocks of text with rolling tables, bullet points, or even cartography. Also, while I'm sure many GMs will appreciate having so much heavy lifting done for them in terms of world building details, for me a lighter touch leaves more room for inspiration to strike, and made the key ideas shine brighter.
</p>
<p>
    None of the above should discourage you from picking this up, to be clear. There's guaranteed fun times in these pages. It's just not an ideal recreational read if you're a cover-to-cover, completionist like me. I'd recommend instead dipping a toe into the chapters that immediately draw you in. You'll find a lot to love.

<h4>July Freebie - Putting the "public" in "public transport"</h4>
<p>
    I'm heading off on holiday tomorrow. I'll be spending 18 days travelling around northern Europe via train. In honour of that epic journey here's 1d20 people you see on public transport in the UK.
