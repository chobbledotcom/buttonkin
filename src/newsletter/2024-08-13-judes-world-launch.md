    If you’re still on the fence about whether to support the campaign I have a handful of handy links to help you make up your danged mind.

    You can watch me talk about the game in this video I filmed and edited myself (yes, yes, hold your applause):

    If you want more talk and less of my face, there's this interview with Fiona over on the What Am I Rolling? podcast: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240814004126/https://www.wairpodcast.com/episodes/qayvrisburke" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20240814004126/https://www.wairpodcast.com/episodes/qayvrisburke</a> (archive link)

    Hopefully one or more of those convinces you that my little game is worth a look. If not, thank you for continuing to read and support this blog! I’ll be back next month with news on how the campaign went, plus some thoughts on what I might work on next. Ta-ra!
