          <h3>Button Kin</h3>
          <p>
            Having run her first game just before the dawn of the pandemic era,
            Yvris (pronounced Eve-ris) suddenly found herself with a lot of time
            to immerse herself in different systems and roleplaying experiences,
            developing a borderline obsession. No more than 6 months later she
            decided to start making her own games. Friends of Yvris will
            recognise this charming combination of hubris a masochism as quite
            typical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawing on a life long love of sci fi, fantasy, whimsy, and wry
            humour, Yvris is best known for her solo RPG about being a baby
            bumble bee, <a href="/bumbling"><i>Bumbling</i></a
            >, her reality TV TTRPG about sassy, cutthroat camelids,
            <a href="/drama-llasmas"><i>Drama Llamas</i></a
            >, and her

          <h3>Jude's World</h3>
          <p>
            Yvris' latest project, <i>Jude's World</i>, is a solo, tarot based
            journaling TTRPG in which a precocious preteen protagonist struggles
            to reunite their warring parents. The game both pays homage to and
            critiques "Parent Trap"-style narratives while reveling in a 90s
            sitcom aesthetic inspired by the likes of <i>Boy Meets World</i>,
            <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i>, and
            <i>Clarissa Explains it All</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players take on the role of the titular Jude: a 12-year-old who's
            desperate to grow up and certain that they'll do a better job of it
            than their parents, Mika and Jamie, who just announced they are
            getting a divorce. Steer your version of Jude through a complicated
            time in their young life and unleash your inner outraged
            almost-teenager. Just remember to tuck them neatly back into your
            subconscious before you go out in public.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jude's World employs a traditional Rider-Waite tarot deck to
            generate story prompts as well as a 2d6 system for resolving Jude's
            attempts to rekindle Mika and Jamie's romance. Play through
            important milestones on Jude's journey into teenhood and explore
            their family's past through the keepsakes and knickknacks you
            uncover around their home. Investigate what happened in Mika and
            Jamie's relationship. Is it salvageable or was it always doomed to
            fail? If there is hope of reuniting them, is Jude the right kid for
            the job? Either way, getting these two people back together won't be
            as simple as it is on TV.
