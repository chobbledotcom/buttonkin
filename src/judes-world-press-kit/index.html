                <h3>Button Kin</h3>
                <p>
                    Having run her first game just before the dawn of the pandemic era, Yvris (pronounced Eve-ris) suddenly found herself with a lot of time to immerse herself in different systems and roleplaying experiences, developing a borderline obsession. No more than 6 months later she decided to start making her own games. Friends of Yvris will recognise this charming combination of hubris a masochism as quite typical. 
                </p><p>
                    Drawing on a life long love of sci fi, fantasy, whimsy, and wry humour, Yvris is best known for her solo RPG about being a baby bumble bee, <a href="/bumbling"><i>Bumbling</i></a>, her reality TV TTRPG about sassy, cutthroat camelids, <a href="/drama-llasmas"><i>Drama Llamas</i></a>, and her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9JJWbzp1YI" target="_blank"><i>work</i></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNjlJOIvbAI" target="_blank"><i>streaming</i></a> with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/girlsruntheseworlds" target="_blank"><i>Girls Run These Worlds</i></a>.

                <h3>Jude's World</h3>
                <p>
                    Yvris' latest project, <i>Jude's World</i>, is a solo, tarot based journaling TTRPG in which a precocious preteen protagonist struggles to reunite their warring parents. The game both pays homage to and critiques "Parent Trap"-style narratives while reveling in a 90s sitcom aesthetic inspired by the likes of <i>Boy Meets World</i>, <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i>, and <i>Clarissa Explains it All</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players take on the role of the titular Jude: a 12-year-old who's desperate to grow up and certain that they'll do a better job of it than their parents, Mika and Jamie, who just announced they are getting a divorce. Steer your version of Jude through a complicated time in their young life and unleash your inner outraged almost-teenager. Just remember to tuck them neatly back into your subconscious before you go out in public.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jude's World employs a traditional Rider-Waite tarot deck to generate story prompts as well as a 2d6 system for resolving Jude's attempts to rekindle Mika and Jamie's romance. Play through important milestones on Jude's journey into teenhood and explore their family's past through the keepsakes and knickknacks you uncover around their home. Investigate what happened in Mika and Jamie's relationship. Is it salvageable or was it always doomed to fail? If there is hope of reuniting them, is Jude the right kid for the job? Either way, getting these two people back together won't be as simple as it is on TV.
